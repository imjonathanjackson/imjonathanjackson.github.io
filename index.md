## Prior Projects

### Air Force Real Time App

Previously I worked in defense contracting building full stack apps for the Air Force. I am comfortable building **secure** and **performant** APIs and services in **Rust**. The application I was in charge of interacted with other services over the network, translating protobuf messages to real time web page updates through websockets. I was the sole developer of the backend service that handled incoming stream data making it easily consumable through an API. All our code was thoroughly documented to meet specifications, with Open API specs and CICD pipeline stages for quality standards and image security scanninng.

I built performant interactive web interfaces using React components and direct drawing in HTML canvas. Application interaction events were all persisted for mission analysis and replay using rrweb.

### Passenger Counter App
I created a simple passenger counting app that is based in JavaScript. The app counts the number of passengers are coming at train station by clicking the increment button. The number can be saved to make additional counts.
